# RainbowCap-project
Dear user,

Welcome to the RainbowCap-project. This project developed a spectral illumination plate for photobiological and optogenetic experiments with 96-well microplates. This resporatory contains supporting files with protocols for microcontroller (sketches) and 3D print files. For further details please see the publication or contact us directly.

## Protocols for microcontroller


## 3D print files
The print files were originally created with the "3D Builder" software (Microsoft) and are optimized for polyamide laser sintering (PA2200, black coloration afterwards). The files are available both as a final version (final merged) and in edit mode (single parts) to allow future optimizations. We provide the print files for three individual components:
1. LED-plate: This plate can be used as a part of the whole RainbowCap system, but can also be used as a universal plate for very simple LED experiments.
2. Filter-plate: This plate is used as a holder for the optical filters and can only be used in combination with the LED plate.
3. Adapter: This component connects the LED-plate with the spectroradiometer (CSS-45, Gigahertz-Optik GmbH, Germany) for calibrations.
